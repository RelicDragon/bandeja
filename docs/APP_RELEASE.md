# App store release baseline

Marks the last commit that was shipped to **Google Play** and **App Store**. Use it to draft the next **What's new** section from everything merged after that point.

## Current baseline

Canonical commit hash: `docs/app-release-baseline.txt` (one line, full SHA).

## Before the next store release

### Unified release CLI (recommended)

```bash
./scripts/app-release.sh
```

Dry-run planner: `APP_RELEASE_DRY_RUN=1 ./scripts/app-release.sh`. Resume after failure: `APP_RELEASE_RESUME=1 ./scripts/app-release.sh`.

See this file for store API credentials, Android signing, and internal-track smoke test steps.

### Headless scripts

Generate **What's new** (LLM summarizes commits since baseline):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/app-release-whats-new.sh
   ```

   Preview prompt without calling the API:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/app-release-whats-new.sh --dry-run
   ```

   Save to a file:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/app-release-whats-new.sh --save release-notes.txt
   ```

   Requires `AI_PROVIDER` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in `Backend/.env`.

   Raw commit list (no LLM):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/app-release-changes.sh
   ./scripts/app-release-changes.sh --full
   ```

**Mark as shipped** (manual fallback after store submission):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/app-release-mark-shipped.sh --commit
   ```

   Run on the branch/commit you shipped (usually right after the version-bump commit). Uses `baseline..HEAD` for the next cycle's What's new.
