# PadelPulse UI Test Plan

> End-to-end and manual UI test catalog for the web app. Based on routes (`App.tsx`), tabs (`MainPage`, `BottomTabBar`), and feature modules in `Frontend/`.

---

## 1. Scope & goals

### In scope
- Web app (Vite dev / preview) — primary automation target
- Responsive layouts: mobile viewport, desktop split views, landscape game details
- All authenticated main tabs: **My**, **Find**, **Chats**, **Market**, **Leaderboard**, **Profile**
- Standalone flows: create game/league, game details, live scoring, club admin
- Auth: login, register, logout, sessions, OAuth (where testable on web)

### Out of scope / manual-only (initially)
- Native Capacitor plugins (camera, push, Apple/Google sign-in on device)
- Real payment / wallet top-up with external providers
- Telegram bot OTP flows (unless test env provides deterministic keys)
- Full multisport matrix (run sampled sports, not every template × sport)

### Definition of done (per release)
- **P0 smoke** passes on staging with seeded data
- **P1 core journeys** pass for at least 2 user personas (player + admin/owner)
- No regressions on chat send/receive and game join/leave

---

## 2. Recommended tooling

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| E2E | **Playwright** | Aligns with `docs/AUTO_TEST_PLAN.md` Phase 4 |
| Auth bootstrap | API fixture + `storageState` | Faster than UI login every test |
| DB | Seeded staging / disposable CI DB | Needs City, clubs, 4+ users for live scoring |
| Selectors | `data-testid` on high-churn UI | Add incrementally to modals, tabs, CTAs |
| Visual | Optional screenshot diff | Stories, live board — high maintenance |

**Suggested layout**

```

## 19. Test matrices

Use these for structured regression sweeps — not every cell needs automation day one.

### 19.1 Entity type matrix

| Entity | Create | Details | Join/leave | Results | Chat |

### 19.4 Viewport matrix

|----------|----------------|
| Mobile 390×844 | P0 + chat full-screen thread |
| Desktop 1280×800 | Split chat, split game details, calendar split |
| Landscape mobile | Game details split view |

## 21. Test execution notes

### Environments
- **Local:** Backend `:3000`, Frontend `:3001`, seeded `padelpulse_dev`
- **CI/staging:** Dedicated test users; never prod credentials
- **Parallelization:** Auth per worker via `storageState`; isolate tests that mutate same game

### Playwright E2E (implemented)

```bash
cd Frontend
# guest smoke only (no credentials):
npm run test:e2e:guest

# authenticated single-user (User A):
npm run test:e2e:auth

# two-user / C2C (User A + User B):
npm run test:e2e:two-user

# full suite (all projects):
npm run test:e2e

# headed / UI runner:
npm run test:e2e:headed
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

Config: `Frontend/playwright.config.ts` — starts Backend + Frontend dev servers when not already running (`reuseExistingServer` locally). Auth bootstrap: `e2e/global-setup.ts` → `e2e/.auth/user-a.json`, `user-b.json` (legacy `user.json` = User A). Example env: `Frontend/e2e/.env.example`.

**E2E users (local dev):** User A `+79672825552`, User B `+79672820000`, password `Metal4me` for both. Override with `E2E_PHONE` / `E2E_PHONE_B`.

**Cross-refs to two-user automation:** `CH-12`/`CH-18` (sender) → receive side `T2-CH-01` in `docs/UI_TEST_PLAN_TWO_USER.md`; `X-06`/`X-07` → `T2-X-01`/`T2-X-02`; `LS-10` → `T2-LS-01`; `M-27` → `T2-M-02`; `GD-42` → `T2-GD-42` (P2).

### Flake mitigation
- Wait for network idle after navigation, not fixed sleeps
- Stub external media upload in CI if S3 empty
- Use `expect.poll` for socket-driven UI (bets, auction, live score)
- Reset filters/localStorage keys (`gameFiltersStorage`, marketplace draft) between tests

### Coverage gaps to track
- Playwright smoke in `Frontend/e2e/specs/smoke/` — expand toward §20 P0 list
- Capacitor-native flows remain manual checklists
- Multisport: automate one sport deeply, sample others in matrix

---

## 22. Suggested first implementation slices

1. **Auth fixture + smoke** — login API, P0 list
2. **Find + join** — filters persistence + join from card
3. **Create game** — GAME template minimal path
4. **Game details edit** — EditGameInfoModal tabs
5. **Chat send** — text + optimistic + offline retry
6. **Marketplace** — create buy-it-now + open drawer
7. **URL overlays** — `?player=` and `?item=` open/close
8. **Onboarding gates** — name gate + past-games subtab

### 22.1 Automated smoke (Playwright)

| ID | Spec | Expected |
|----|------|----------|
| E2E-S01 | `guest.spec.ts` unauthenticated `/` | Redirect to `/login` |
| E2E-S02 | `guest.spec.ts` login shell | Phone + Telegram entry visible |
| E2E-S03 | `login.spec.ts` phone login | Lands on home with bottom tabs |
| E2E-S04 | `navigation.spec.ts` tabs | My / Find / Chats / Market visible |
| E2E-S05 | `navigation.spec.ts` routing | Tab clicks update URL |

---

## 23. Two-user interaction testing

Full catalog: **`docs/UI_TEST_PLAN_TWO_USER.md`**.

Playwright project `two-user` runs specs under `Frontend/e2e/specs/two-user/` tagged `@two-user`. Uses dual `storageState` files and `openDualSession()` (`e2e/fixtures/two-user.fixture.ts`). Prefer `expect.poll` for socket-driven assertions.

| T2-P0 (automated) | Maps from main plan |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| T2-CH-01, T2-CH-02 | CH-12, CH-18, X-07 |
| T2-GD-01, T2-GD-03 | GD-08, X-06 |
| T2-X-01, T2-X-02 | X-07, X-06 |
